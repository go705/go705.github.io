In this invited online talk at [Cornell University](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3), I presented a neuromorphic photonic sensing framework that leverages micro-ring interferometric structures to perform physics-based convolution on RF signals. I also discussed early prototypes of quantum-enhanced sensor networks and how machine learning can co-design photonic architectures.
