This talk, delivered to the [University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1) Physics & Astronomy community, surveyed advances in continuous-variable photonics, squeezed-light generation, and machine-learning-assisted quantum information architectures. I discussed chip-integrated implementations and opportunities for combining physics-based modeling with data-driven optimization.
