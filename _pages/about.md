The **Quantum AI Laboratory (QuAiL)** focuses on the intersection of quantum optics, photonics, and machine learning. Our mission is to leverage resonant light-matter interactions and advanced computational techniques to develop high-efficiency quantum frequency conversion and optical information processing systems.

Currently, we are exploring:
* **High-efficiency Four-Wave Mixing:** Optimizing conversion efficiency using spatially varied control fields.
* **Quantum Neural Networks:** Implementing machine learning architectures using photonic platforms.
* **Resonant Light-Matter Interaction:** Studying cold atoms and EIT-based systems for quantum memory.
