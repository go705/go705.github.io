<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
I am a Christian and a member of the <a href="https://tjc.org/usa/">True Jesus Church</a>. The most beautiful thing that has happened in my life is coming to know God. Life is often filled with hardships and setbacks, and there have been times when I felt weak or even lost my faith. Yet in those moments, God continually gives me strength and gently guides me to experience His good and perfect will. From the depths of my heart, I have come to know His love as real, personal, and deeply comforting.

The Bible says, “Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28) This is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and He is also the God I have come to know and trust. I warmly invite you to explore this God with me and discover His love and guidance in your own life.

This website is a space where I share my personal testimony, reflections on faith, and resources that have been meaningful to me. It is meant not only as a record of my spiritual journey, but also as an invitation to reflect on life, purpose, and the questions that touch both heart and mind. I hope these reflections can offer a gentle space for anyone seeking meaning, exploring life’s questions, or discovering the connection between faith and daily living.
