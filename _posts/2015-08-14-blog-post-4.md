In the name of our Lord Jesus, I want to share how God led me into marriage and the lessons I learned along the way. My wife Abby and I are grateful to serve in the church marriage ministry in Boston, and we hope that by sharing our journey, especially with single brothers and sisters, we can encourage one another in faith and understanding.

## Early Thoughts About Marriage

When I first encountered the faith, I attended a campus fellowship for university students. I still remember being encouraged to seek a spouse within the True Jesus Church and to commit to marrying in the Lord. Even though I was just a seeker at the time, I understood the wisdom of this guidance.  

Faith is not just about saying “I believe” when asked. It is about **living for God with our whole life**, even in the most important areas, including marriage. God desires to give us a companion, but He also wants us to understand His love through that relationship. Marriage in the Lord is not just personal—it is a spiritual partnership, where we grow together in faith.  

Because of this, from the moment I accepted the faith, I prayed daily about marriage. I looked forward to it with both anticipation and reverence.

## Facing Family and Inner Struggles

My father, who is not a believer, often questioned my commitment:

> “How do you know a non-believer won’t come to faith with you?”  
> “Why think about marriage now? Wait until the time comes.”  
> “If you limit yourself to True Jesus Church members, you might miss good opportunities.”

Indeed, from a worldly perspective, someone outside the church may have more achievements. But in the Lord, our goal is not worldly excellence. We seek someone who **can walk with us in the path of God**, who can support us spiritually, and with whom we can experience God’s love.  

Despite my father’s concerns, I trusted God to guide me to the right companion.

## Overcoming Anxiety and Taking Steps of Faith

After university, I was of marriageable age, but I had no experience in courtship. I longed for marriage, but I was anxious and fearful. I avoided introductions from the church and the marriage ministry, always saying, **“I am not ready yet.”**  

I realized later that this excuse was just my anxiety. I was **afraid to take steps**, even though I longed to move forward. But God placed two spiritual companions in my life—believers who shared my desire for marriage. We encouraged each other to **set a deadline** and take steps of faith, whether by meeting someone ourselves or accepting introductions. This accountability helped me overcome fear and gain courage.

## Learning to Trust God’s Timing

At first, I tried to pursue relationships within my familiar circle. But I quickly realized that **introductions and courtship are not easy**, and my attempts often ended in rejection. I experienced many failed introductions and felt disheartened, especially when my confidence and my application to a U.S. doctoral program were also rejected.  

During this time, I learned to **release control and fully trust God**. I prayed:

> “Lord, I want to study in the U.S., but I don’t want to pursue marriage on my own terms.  
> I trust that You will guide me to the right person at the right time.”

I decided that I would **accept introductions without knowing in advance who the person was**. I would trust God’s timing and let Him lead.

## God’s Faithfulness

Soon after, the marriage ministry contacted me again to arrange an introduction. This time, I did not know who the sister was, and I simply agreed. A few weeks later, I learned it was the same sister I had met at the campus fellowship in Taiwan—a sister whose faith, character, and heart for the Lord were truly admirable. Through the Lord’s guidance, we began to get to know each other, and before moving to the U.S., we decided to marry. That sister is now my wife, Abby.

Abby’s perspective is also worth sharing. She recalls noticing me in the fellowship but did not actively pursue anything. When her aunt (a marriage ministry volunteer) introduced me, she prayed and trusted God, seeing His guidance through small signs and His timing. This experience showed that **God’s hand is behind every step in His plan**.

## Lessons Learned

From this journey, I learned several truths about marriage in the Lord:

1. **Do your part and prepare yourself.** Understand your own expectations and character, but do not let anxiety or fear prevent you from accepting God’s guidance.  
2. **God is the true matchmaker.** Church introductions and marriage ministry arrangements are just His tools. Trust Him completely.  
3. **Courage and faith matter.** Sometimes you must step forward even without knowing the outcome, trusting that God works in all things for good.  
4. **Patience and faith in God’s timing are essential.** Marriage is also an opportunity to experience God’s love.  

We sometimes ask, *“Is this person God’s will for me?”* The Bible gives a clear answer: **“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and love others as yourself.”** (Matthew 22:37-39) If we love God and our spouse faithfully, we will walk according to His will.

## Conclusion

Marriage in the Lord is not about finding the “perfect” person. It is about trusting God, loving your spouse fully, and **allowing God to guide your steps**.  

Looking back, I am grateful for the trials, the guidance of the church, and the faithful prayers of spiritual companions. God’s plan is perfect, and His timing is always right.  

**May all glory be to the Lord Jesus Christ, who leads and sustains us. Amen.**
