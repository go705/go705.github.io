When I first encountered the faith, I attended a campus fellowship for university students. I still remember being encouraged to seek a spouse within the True Jesus Church and to commit to marrying in the Lord. Even though I was just a seeker at the time, I understood the wisdom of this guidance.  

Faith is not just about saying “I believe” when asked. It is about **living for God with our whole life**, even in the most important areas, including marriage. God desires to give us a companion, but He also wants us to understand His love through that relationship. Marriage in the Lord is not just personal—it is a spiritual partnership, where we grow together in faith.  

Because of this, from the moment I accepted the faith, I prayed daily about marriage. I looked forward to it with both anticipation and reverence.

## Facing Family and Inner Struggles

My father, who is not a believer, often questioned my commitment:

> “How do you know a non-believer won’t come to faith with you?”  
> “Why think about marriage now? Wait until the time comes.”  
> “If you limit yourself to True Jesus Church members, you might miss good opportunities.”

Indeed, from a worldly perspective, someone outside the church may have more achievements. But in the Lord, our goal is not worldly excellence. We seek someone who **can walk with us in the path of God**, who can support us spiritually, and with whom we can experience God’s love.  

Despite my father’s concerns, I trusted God to guide me to the right companion.

## Overcoming Anxiety and Taking Steps of Faith

After university, I was of marriageable age, but I had no experience in courtship. I longed for marriage, but I was anxious and fearful. I avoided introductions from the church and the marriage ministry, always saying, **“I am not ready yet.”**  

I realized later that this excuse was just my anxiety. I was **afraid to take steps**, even though I longed to move forward. But God placed two spiritual companions in my life—believers who shared my desire for marriage. We encouraged each other to **set a deadline** and take steps of faith, whether by meeting someone ourselves or accepting introductions. This accountability helped me overcome fear and gain courage.

## Learning to Trust God’s Timing

At first, I tried to pursue relationships within my familiar circle. But I quickly realized that **introductions and courtship are not easy**, and my attempts often ended in rejection. I experienced many failed introductions and felt disheartened, especially when my confidence and my application to a U.S. doctoral program were also rejected.  

During this time, I learned to **release control and fully trust God**. I prayed:

> “Lord, I want to study in the U.S., but I don’t want to pursue marriage on my own terms.  
> I trust that You will guide me to the right person at the right time.”

I decided that I would **accept introductions without knowing in advance who the person was**. I would trust God’s timing and let Him lead.

## God’s Faithfulness

Soon after, the marriage ministry contacted me again to arrange an introduction. This time, I did not know who the sister was, and I simply agreed. A few weeks later, I learned it was the same sister I had met at the campus fellowship in Taiwan—a sister whose faith, character, and heart for the Lord were truly admirable. Through the Lord’s guidance, we began to get to know each other, and before moving to the U.S., we decided to marry. That sister is now my wife.


## Conclusion

Marriage in the Lord is not about finding the “perfect” person. It is about trusting God, loving your spouse fully, and **allowing God to guide your steps**.  

Looking back, I am grateful for the trials, the guidance of the church, and the faithful prayers of spiritual companions. God’s plan is perfect, and His timing is always right.  

**May all glory be to the Lord Jesus Christ, who leads and sustains us. Amen.**
