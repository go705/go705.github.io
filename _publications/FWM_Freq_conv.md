In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new scheme of resonant four-wave mixing (FWM) for frequency up- or down-conversion. By utilizing spatially varied control fields, we convert a probe field into a signal field with high efficiency. We show that the efficiency of probe-to-signal energy conversion can reach 90% at a medium optical depth of approximately 100. This scheme is flexible, working for both continuous-wave and pulsed light.

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported—for example, the conversion efficiency $$\eta$$ can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the spatial profile of the control fields—however, the use
