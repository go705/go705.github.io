In this work, we propose a new scheme of resonant four-wave mixing (FWM) for frequency up- or down-conversion. Unlike commonly used non-resonant FWM schemes, our approach utilizes spatially varied control fields to convert a probe field at the input into a signal field at the output with high efficiency. We demonstrate that the efficiency of probe-to-signal energy conversion can reach 90% at a medium optical depth of approximately 100. This scheme is flexible, working for both continuous-wave and pulsed light, and provides a robust tool for nonlinear frequency conversion.

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported—for example, the conversion efficiency $\eta$ can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the spatial profile of the control fields $\Omega_{c1}$ and $\Omega_{c2}$—however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$`.
