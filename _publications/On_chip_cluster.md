Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states are a fundamental resource for measurement-based quantum computing. In this work, we propose a method to generate large-scale, multidimensional CV cluster states by multiplexing in both the time and frequency domains. By utilizing a single squeezed-light source and standard telecommunications components, this architecture offers a highly scalable and robust platform for photonic quantum information processing.
