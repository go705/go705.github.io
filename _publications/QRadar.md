Entanglement has been known to boost target detection, despite being destroyed by lossy-noisy propagation. In this study, we propose a dual-receiver radar scheme that employs a high time-bandwidth product microwave pulse entangled with a pre-shared reference signal. We show that the direction-resolving capability is significantly improved by entanglement, identifying applicable scenarios for short-range and high-frequency radar applications.
