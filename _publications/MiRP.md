The micro-ring perceptron (MiRP) sensor overcomes the limitations of conventional RF sensing, such as detector noise and Nyquist rate sampling requirements. By embedding nonlinear optical dynamics into an end-to-end architecture, the MiRP sensor maps input signals into a learned feature space, enabling efficient classification of low-power signals even at 1/49 the Nyquist rate.
