This paper introduces a genuine continuous-variable (CV) quantum-repeater architecture designed to relay CV quantum information over long distances. By integrating CV quantum teleportation with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correction, the architecture suppresses the noise accumulated during transmission through lossy bosonic channels. We demonstrate the practical benefits of this design across three key applications: entanglement-assisted communication, quantum illumination-based target detection, and CV quantum key distribution.
