Bidirectional Nonlinear Optical Tomography (BNOT) is a platform-agnostic method that uses forward and backward pumping of complementary nonlinear probes to estimate individual interface efficiencies. By framing efficiency extraction as a joint constrained optimization, this method links off-chip measurements to on-chip quantities while accounting for pump fluctuations and detector noise.
