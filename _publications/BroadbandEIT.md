In this work, we implement a broadband optical memory by utilizing the EIT protocol in an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}\text{Rb}$ atoms. By optimizing the control field intensity and the optical depth of the medium, we achieve storage of pulses with durations as short as several tens of nanoseconds.
