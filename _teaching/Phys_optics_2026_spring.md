Have you ever looked at a laser beam, a rainbow, or a hologram and wondered what physics truly makes them possible? In this course, you will discover how light behaves as a wave, how interference and diffraction shape every optical pattern we see, and how electromagnetic theory explains the rich structure of modern photonics. We will explore the concepts that make optical technology powerful—Gaussian beams, Fourier optics, polarization, dispersion, coherence, and ultimately the quantum and nonlinear properties of light. You will also learn how these principles appear in real systems, from imaging and fiber optics to photon statistics and nonlinear devices. This course is designed for students who want a rigorous and intuitive foundation in physical optics. By the end, you will be able to analyze complex optical systems, understand the physics behind current photonics research, and see how optical science continues to shape today’s technology. Join us and explore the fascinating world of light.

In this course, students will learn:

## Basics of physical optics
Learn how light behaves as a wave by studying interference, diffraction, polarization, and Gaussian beams. You will use Maxwell’s equations and wave-optics tools to understand how real optical fields propagate and interact with materials.

## Optical system and imaging
Apply physical-optics concepts to lenses, apertures, waveguides, and fibers. You will learn how imaging systems form resolution-limited pictures, how coherence affects optical performance, and how dispersion and modal structure shape fiber-optic communication.

## Modern Photonics and Quantum Optics
Explore photon statistics, coherence theory, and the basics of quantum and nonlinear optics. You will see how phenomena such as shot noise, vacuum fluctuations, and nonlinear frequency conversion appear in advanced photonic technologies.
